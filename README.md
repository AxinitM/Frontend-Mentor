Hello, everyone! My name is Andrey Martynenko, and I am a beginner frontender. 

Willing to listen to any feedback. Especially comments and suggestions on how to improve the code. If you have critical remarks, I am ready for them too. 
I like when people criticise my work reasonably, such criticism makes me better ;)
